        <p className="mt-6">I’ve worn multiple hats across AI, product, growth, and content — and that lets me move from idea to execution without friction. I start from first principles, clarify the goal, and build exactly what’s needed. No fluff, just outcomes.</p>
        <p className="mt-4">Whether it’s architecting an AI system, launching a website, optimizing a funnel, or crafting a narrative, I keep things grounded in user value and business impact. I work collaboratively and communicate clearly.</p>
